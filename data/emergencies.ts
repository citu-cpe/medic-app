          Advice for first aiders
          As a first aider, in addition to high quality clinical skills, to be effective you need to:
          1. Be aware of the risks to yourself and others
          2. Keep yourself safe
          3. Give early treatment
          4. Keep yourself informed and updated
          5. Remember your own needs
          

          In the current climate with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, these skills become even more important
          and here is how you can apply these skills when managing a first aid incident.
          Our guidance
          
          
          1. Be aware of the risks to yourself and others
          When approaching a casualty there is always a risk of cross contamination – especially when you may have to get close to the casualty to assess what is wrong or to check their breathing. It is always important to be aware of the risks of how this cross contamination has occurred. According to NHS 111 we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person but similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.
          
          
          2. Keep yourself safe
          In line with government advice, make sure you wash your hands or use an alcohol gel, before and after treating a casualty also ensure that you don’t cough or sneeze over a casualty when you are treating them.
          
          The Resuscitation Council (UK) provides some useful advice of how to keep yourself safe when providing CPR. You can read their full advice on their website here.
          
          Don’t lose sight of other cross contamination that could occur that isn’t related to COVID-19.
            o Wear gloves or cover hands when dealing with open wounds
            o Cover cuts and grazes on your hands with waterproof dressing
            o Dispose of all waste safely
            o Do not touch a wound with your bare hand
            o Do not touch any part of a dressing that will come in contact with a wound.
          
          
          3. Give early treatment
          The vast majority of incidents do not involve you getting close to a casualty where you would come into contact with cough droplets. Sensible precautions will ensure you are able to treat a casualty effectively.
          
          
          4. Keep yourself informed and updated
          As this is a new disease this is an ever changing situation and the government and DOH are continually updating their advice.
          
          5. Remember your own needs
          These are challenging and uncertain times for all. The COVID-19 outbreak has meant a lot of upheaval and worry for people. In order to help others you will also need to look after your own needs. Make sure you take time to talk about your fears and concerns with someone you trust and to take out time to look after yourself.`,

          If you're faced with bleeding:
          
          1.Rinse the wound with water if possible.
          2.Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (towel, blanket, clothing, whatever's available).
          3.Apply direct pressure to stop the blood flow and encourage clotting.
          4.If possible, elevate the bleeding body part above the heart.
          5.Don't remove the cloth if it becomes soaked through, but add more layers if needed. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss.
          6.Once bleeding is stopped, apply a clean bandage.

          1.Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward
          2.Put your arms around their waist
          3.Clench a fist and place it between their navel and rib cage
          4.Grab your fist with your other hand
          5.Pull the clenched fist sharply backward and upward under their rib cage in 5 quick thrusts. Repeat until the object is coughed up.
          
          For someone who's obese or pregnant, perform thrusts around the chest instead of the abdomen.
          
          If someone is unconscious:
          
          1.Place them on their back and kneel over them
          2.Place the heel of your hand slightly above the navel

          1.Get someone to call 911 or the medical alert system for your location.
          2.Start chest compressions immediately. Push down hard and fast in the center of the chest, allowing the chest to come back up naturally between compressions. Continue until someone with more training has arrived.
          3.If you're trained in CPR, use chest compressions and rescue breathing.
          4.Use an AED if one is available. It's important to not delay chest compressions, though, so have someone else find one while you do chest compressions.

          Treating frostbite is a delicate procedure of gradual warming. If at all possible, this should be done by professionals at a medical facility. If that's not possible, or while awaiting an ambulance, you can begin first aid:
          
          1.Get out of the cold.
          2.Immerse the affected area in warm water (98 to 105 F) for 20 to 30 minutes.
          3.Do not rub the affected area.
          4.Do not use sources of dry heat (like a heating pad or fire air).
          5.For fingers and toes: After they're warm, put clean cotton balls between them.
          6.Loosely wrap the area with bandages.
          7.Use Tylenol or Advil for pain.
          8.Get medical attention as soon as possible.
          
          For small areas of minor frostbite, you can also warm the area with skin-to-skin contact.
          
          Get emergency treatment if the skin is hard and begins turning white.

        Gun Defense
        Your first line of defense with a gun is either going to be your legs or your voice depending on
        the type of situation and conflict that the gun is drawn in. Depending on the situation, if you
        are able to evade the situation by running this is always wise, but sometimes guns can be
        drawn when people are with their families, out with their friends or loved ones and it may not
        be smart to leave these people behind and run. If you can’t run, try and deescalate the
        situation by talking and giving into the demands of the assailant, assuming they are not
        hazardous or horrific. If all they want is your watch and wallet give it to them. No possession
        is worth risking your life, if they want something more terrible like your child, you may have
        to take action.

        When confronting a gun with physical defense there should be two primary goals at
        hand. The first goal should be to get yourself out of the line of fire, if you are with loved ones
        or friends, get them out of the line of fire as well. How is this accomplished? Well you need to
        grab the barrel of the weapon strategically and move it so no one is in the line of fire. This is
        extremely important. After successfully getting yourself out of the line of fire, you will want to
        proceed to disarm your assailant. Disarming somebody is a lot easier said than done and
        hopefully you will never find yourself in a position where it is necessary to have to do this but
        you never know.

        Knife Defense
        Knives are some of the most dangerous weapons and much like with a gun the best defense
        is evasion and de-escalation. You want to try and run or talk your way out of it. We all know
        that this is much easier said than done and that sometimes it is unrealistic to think we can
        talk or run our way out of a situation. So what if we can’t? What if we are with our family or
        our children and we can’t just leave them there while we run?

        When you are dealing with a knife, much like with a gun, you want to get out of the line of
        danger; you need to control your attackers arm. This should be the primary focus when
        dealing with a knife. Get a hold of their arm and control where that knife goes. Do not try and
        take them down, punch them or kick them. Address the problem at hand, which is the
        knife. Knives can cause an extreme amount of damage, you don’t want to wrestle around
        with your attacker because you can get cut or stabbed, you also don’t want to stand in front
        of them and try to fight them traditionally, you can also get cut or stabbed.
