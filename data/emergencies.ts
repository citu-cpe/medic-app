          If you're faced with bleeding:
          
          1.Rinse the wound with water if possible.
          2.Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (towel, blanket, clothing, whatever's available).
          3.Apply direct pressure to stop the blood flow and encourage clotting.
          4.If possible, elevate the bleeding body part above the heart.
          5.Don't remove the cloth if it becomes soaked through, but add more layers if needed. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss.
          6.Once bleeding is stopped, apply a clean bandage.`,

          7.Use Tylenol or Advil for pain.
          8.Get medical attention as soon as possible.
          
          For small areas of minor frostbite, you can also warm the area with skin-to-skin contact.
          
          Get emergency treatment if the skin is hard and begins turning white. `,
